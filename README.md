# Typetanic

**All the goodness of dedicated object types without the setup hassle**
> #### *Health Warning!*
*These are all part of my drive to use more domain specific objects. If the object you want is not like the object defined here write your own. Or wrap with an adapter*

## Included
1. Email

#### Email
Email validation is a tricky topic

> username@domain.toptevel.domain

hostnames are well defined on wikipedia
the whole email and local part less so.
