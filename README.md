# Typetanic

**All the goodness of dedicated object types without the setup hassle**
> #### *Health Warning!*
*These are all part of my drive to use more domain specific objects. If the object you want is not like the object defined here write your own. Or wrap with an adapter*

## Included
1. Email

#### Email
Email validation is a tricky topic

http://isemail.info/about

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address

https://github.com/mikel/mail/blob/master/lib/mail/elements/address.rb

> local@hostname
> username@domain.toptevel.domain

hostnames are well defined on wikipedia
the whole email and local part less so.

Probably should go for immutability so hand out copies when querying string

#### Boolean
The boolean class is odd in that it returns true or false and not instances

#### Integer

```rb
class Frozen
  def initialize(value)
    define_singleton_method :value do
      value
    end
    freeze
  end

end
```

## Installation
